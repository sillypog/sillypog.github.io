 	<h1>Symantec Campfire sales visualisation</h1>

    <p>Campfire is a sales visualisation kiosk created by San Francisco's Redshift for Symantec. Redshift designed the application and used a distributed team of developers to implement it. I was brought in towards the end of the project in order to modify the working prototype to handle live data. Taking on such a large code base (166 non-library classes, 12400 lines of code) from developers I hadn't met was a new challenge for me but I was able to deliver a rock-solid end product that runs continuously and has no problems handling constantly changing data.</p>

    <p>The application is divided into three channels - Live Sales which shows data for individual sales, Maps which aggregates data geographically, and Trending which aggregates data over time. My initial remit was to replace hard coded data values from the Live Sales channel with a system to read values from an XML feed, but I also fixed several issues in the other channels prior to launch. Although I found the application to be well designed and implemented, some of the inital assumptions about the nature of the data proved to be inaccurate. A lot of the issues related to the range of the data, in that the largest sales would often be so large that smaller sales were all scaled to the same small number; this would result in the Stars & Stripes in the above image taking up most of the screen and the other flags being reduced to 1 pixel. I used different scaling and limiting algorithms across the channels to fix this in a way that was both visually appealing and respectful of the message in the data</p>
    <p>Another issue was that the application expected perfectly formatted data, although this was frequently not the case. In some cases I merely needed to provide default values for missing fields, but other issues were more complex. Although the application is coded in Actionscript 3, the existing data handling features in the Maps and Trending channels did not make much use of E4X syntax for pasrsing the XML, relying instead on pulling values from fixed child positions; I had to make several changes in these areas to ensure the application remained robust when nodes became repositioned in the XML as they tended to do. Not being able to control the XML feed itself meant that I had to add some preprocessing features to sort and remove nodes that were not present. For example, the Maps relied on 'District' nodes to separate sales across large areas like USA; this data was not actually available in the feed so rather than change working code, I averaged the total value across the number of expected regions and added corresponding nodes to the XML object prior to passing it to the parser.</p>
	<p>To ensure that the application would be able to handle any data that was passed into it, I wrote a number of scripts to generate data to test edge cases. I began with writing these in Actionscript and copying the output from the console, but I later switched to Perl and LibXML as I felt in important that the client also be able to run scripts to generate their own data. This was particularly useful for the Trending channel as it exposed a number of bugs that would occur on new months, new years and leap years. I was further able to empower the client by moving many of the parameters from the code to an XML file, allowing them to directly see the effect of certain settings (such as data scaling constants) on the visual results.</p>
