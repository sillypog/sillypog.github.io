    <h3><a href="/projects/jabra/index.html" target="_blank">Launch application</a></h3>
    <p>This iPad slot machine app was a Loomis Group project for our client, <a href="http://www.jabra.com" target="_blank">Jabra</a>. The goal was to create a fun, noticeable experience that would bring tradeshow attendees into the Jabra booth at a Las Vegas tradeshow. I was responsible for all development on the application, including programming, asset production, sound design and final delivery. The application proved to be hugely popular at the show and I have since modified it for subsequent shows.</p>

    <span class="quoteMark">&#8220;</span><p>When lined up next to dozens of other like service and product providers, a real challenge at trade shows is having your booth stand out amongst the rest. Since the show happened to be in Las Vegas, we decided to play to our environment – dinging bells, cheering crowds and prizes. We projected our "slot machine" app on a giant plasma screen in the booth, turned up the volume, and the leads started rolling in. For a scan of the badge, an attendee got one "spin" on the machine. With nearly 100 prizes (including iPads, iPod shuffles, and CASH), our booth was constantly filled with hopeful "spinners" and we pulled in nearly half of the available leads at the entire show.<p>
	<p>But the success didn’t stop at the leads. Over the 3 day show, attendees and other booth vendors continually came to Jabra's booth and asked for pictures of the set up. "Who did that app?" "Who designed your booth?" "We would love something like that! How do we get one?". To each question, our client responded: We we work with the most amazing and innovative agency called the Loomis Group! This was all their idea!</p>

    <p>Given the short amount of development time, I chose to create the application in Flash and publish with Air for iOS. As we were delivering a single iPad installation to the client, this simplified the Apple certification process. Players interacted with the iPad, with the screen being mirrored on a large television display so that passers-by would be drawn in.</p>
    <p>The most crucial aspect of the application was controlling prize distribution. Although the payouts appear random, there were a limited number of each type of prize so the data model keeps track of how many prizes of each type are available. When a spin is initiated, a random number selection determines whether the spin will be successful by comparison with a threshold value. If the spin was successful, a prize is popped from the shuffled array of prizes. I didn't know how many spins there would be each day, so to ensure prizes are paid out at an acceptable rate, the app automatically varies the threshold value based on the system clock, the number of prizes, the presence of remaining prizes from previous days, and some other factors. This approach, coupled with a seeded random number generator, allowed me to simulate a variety of scenarios prior to launch; when the account executive called me from the show with concerns about the prize distribution, I was able to reassure her by showing her where we were based on the simulations.</p>
    <p>With the outcome of the spin predetermined, the prizeID is passed to the SpinController class to determine what items to show in each of the spinner windows. When the spin is unsuccessful, the spinners are set to random values with the caveat that if the second window may not match the first - this avoids accidentally showing a winning value. If the spin was successful, all three spinners are set to the appropriate image for the prize type. The spinning animation itself is achieved with a single BitmapData representation of the prize images. This object is not shown directly; instead, each spinner tweens a Rectangle object over the prize strip, taking a snap shot of the pixels at that position for each frame. This makes for a very lightweight component that can be reused at little memory cost.</p>
    <p>The application makes use of a few features that the Air API provides. The prize payouts are written to disk using the flash.filesystem.* classes. If the application is closed between uses, the prize log is read back in and the list of available prizes is reconstructed to account for those paid out. The disk write only occurs when a Event.EXITING is dispatched by the NativeApplication. The logging functions are wrapped in CONFIG::IOS conditional compilation statements and are not included in the web version.</p>
