				<h3>Support for huge collections</h3>
				<p><strong>All your cards, one flat fee.</strong> The number of cards you can store in Card Commander is limited only by the amount of storage available on your phone. So even if you've been collecting since Alpha, you'll never outgrow this app. You can have as many decks as you like as well (you can never have too many decks). All this with no subscriptions or in-app purchases, just the one-time App Store payment.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="pitch">
				<h3>Super fast and accurate card entry</h3>
				<p><strong>Add cards to your library using their set code and collection numbers.</strong> Other apps making it difficult to find <em>your</em> reprint of Evolving Wilds? Drowning in a sea of similar Islands? Card Commander makes it easy to find the exact version of your card using the set code and collector number, giving you the correct card every time. Even better - you can add a whole booster pack with just a handful of keystrokes.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="pitch">
				<h3>Comprehensive filtering and search options</h3>
				<p><strong>A simple interface backed by SQLite.</strong> If you've been struggling to find all of your legendary equipment jellyfish for your latest tribal deck, Card Commander has you covered. Your card collection is stored in a local SQLite database allowing complex search queries to filter your cards on a variety of criteria. A simple interface makes running these queries a snap.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="pitch">
				<h3>A fun deck building experience</h3>
				<p><strong>Drag-and-drop with real time analytics.</strong> When you build decks in Card Commander, all of its powerful library filtering options are available to you. The drag-and-drop experience feels like you're working with real cards. Real-time deck analytics give you instant feedback on the changes you're making, ensuring you stay on curve.<p>
			</section>
			<section class="pitch">
				<h3>Track your physical cards</h3>
				<p><strong>Storage and sleeve data for each of your cards.</strong> Card Commander keeps track of each copy of the cards you own separately and allows you to enter information about where you keep that card and how it is sleeved. So if you're sharing one Sol Ring between all of your commander Decks, Card Commander can save you time when you're searching for it.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="pitch">
				<h3>Own your data</h3>
				<p><strong>Access your collection, wherever you go.</strong> Imprisoned in the Moon with no signal? With Card Commander it's an opportunity to build a new deck. Instead of sending your data to someone else's server, Card Commander stores all of your card and deck data on your device. That means you always have access to your library. You can export your SQLite database to iCloud at any time so you are always in control of your data.</p>
